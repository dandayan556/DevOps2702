This project is a collection of three captivating and interactive games. Developed with a focus on user engagement, this project showcases my skills in game development, problem-solving, and creating intuitive user interfaces. The games include 'Memory Game' for testing memory recall, 'Guess the Number' for challenging numerical guessing skills, and 'Currency Roulette' that leverages real-time currency exchange rates for an exciting guessing game. I incorporated best practices in coding, modular design, and integration with external APIs. The project demonstrates my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to deliver engaging user experiences.
